### FAQS

- *How to setup the whatsapp notifications?*

**First sign up your number in the `User` options and then send `join nearly-buffalo` to your TWILIO_NUMBER. Do not send SMS.**

- *Having problems with the whatsapp registration?*

**Keep in mind that you will have to enter the whole phone number, including your country code. E.g., Argentina: +549.**

- *Receiving neither email nor whatsapp notifications?*

**Well... Though the posibilities are low, it could always be possible that the server exploded. Or maybe you typed your address and number wrongly.**
